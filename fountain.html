      <p>
        For this project I worked with a concrete boulder that I created at the
        start of the Covid-19 pandemic. <br />
        When the lockdown started here in The Netherlands I began to transport
        this “rock” across the city by hand to a different site every few weeks.
        I would leave it in the public space outside houses, museums and parks.
        As the rock started to gain the public attention and interest as to
        whats it purpose was people started to request the presence of the rock
        in their neighborhoods, or outside their galleries. This was a way of
        them almost grasping the artwork while very much shaping the project.
        The photo below is from the series of “rock talk” events that I worked
        on with a group of young artist initiatives. In the first two of these
        gatherings we began to discuss how to continue collectively after the
        corona crisis. The rock was a space for a discourse that included the
        artsit community alongside the everyday public that passed by. To the
        right is a photo of a publication that I made to conclude the project,
        it included the dialogues between me and the public from the whole of
        the project. The publication was then distributed between everyone who
        encountered the rock, in the neighborhoods where the rock had been
        present and the galleries that had hosted it.

        Rock Why? D: So it started with the idea of the bar, “whiskey on the
        rocks”, which was to have the rock as this object there, as this
        presence and reason for people to gather. J: It comes from Hgtomi Rosa’s
        concerns in thinking about the meaning of space, about audiences, and
        about why people would be somewhere. It relates to the encounter, to why
        people are with the thing that you want to show. This is what we always
        discuss, and what is also behind the rock talks. Y: We were as well just
        curious: How are the others doing? What are they doing? Are they just
        sitting in their studios making art alone? D: When I spoke with Robin I
        realized the potential of this encounter, how people were becoming
        audiences and participants to his rock. When someone asked Robin to move
        the rock, he performed this gesture, the artist moving the rock. I
        thought: this is a good rock to bring people together. I asked him to
        place it in front of Hgtomi Rosa to open our doors again and see what
        would happen. A: There is novelty in the simplicity of a rock as an
        object, in being able to share a physical moment with the ones we were
        previously surrounded by. J: And experiencing absence had further lead
        us to reflect on the interaction with others. It became clearer that it
        had to do with ideas of collaboration, and sharing thoughts and
        knowledge.
