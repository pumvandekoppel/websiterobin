              Act 1. A walk along Denneweg 21/04/2023 with fountain followed by 2 pedestals. In the evening an oyster party was organised around the fountain at Bistro Mer. 
              Recorded by the public on the street who I asked to film me with a hand-cam while I walked away.

              Over the last semester, as part of a long standing collaboration
              between the Fine Arts department and Nest, a number of our
              students from the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year have reacted to the
              exhibition ‘The Grand Palace of Everyone’, which closed last week.
              Borrowing similar motivations, ‘Peas and Carrots’ focusses on
              collaboration, with a person, being or force outside of
              themselves, opening up their practice to others.
