            Robin Whitehouse <b>&</b> a spring market, Thordur Hans Baldursson &
            a queue of musicians, Emma Sebregts & Jeanne van Steenbergen, Pum

            Over the last semester, as part of a long standing collaboration
            between the Fine Arts department and Nest, a number of our students
            from the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year have reacted to the exhibition ‘The
            Grand Palace of Everyone’, which closed last week. Borrowing similar
            motivations, ‘Peas and Carrots’ focusses on collaboration, with a
            person, being or force outside of themselves, opening up their
            practice to others.
            <br /><br />
            The students were selected via open call as part of the Fine Art
            department electives and were guided in their process by three
            professional coaches: Jan Hoek, Clementine Edwards and Tim
            Hollander."
