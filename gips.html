            Through mixed conversations and reports I uncovered the hidden
            basement of the Academy on the 20th February 2023. Over the
            following months I have began to excavate areas of the piles of
            plaster in the basement with the intention to piece back together
            aspects of the smashed plaster sculptures. I estimated it to be well over 5 tones of
            plaster fragments and pieces that are from the copies that
            made up the former Gips Museum of The Royal Academy of Art the
            Hague.

            Images of the moment of returning the gips collection to KABK. <br> As a part
            of my graduation show I wanted to bring back together the remaining
            plaster collection. As a part of this I requested to loan
            4 plaster sculptures that used to belong the KABK from the
            1900s-1970s. In the 70s they were taken by the Allard Pierson
            collection to Amsterdam to save them from being destroyed. I
            requested to loan these pieces that used to be housed in the KABK
            and bring them back to where they used to stand 100 years ago. I
            worked with Hizkia and initiated it to take place. The figures were
            returned to the room where they used to stand 100 years ago and
            placed upon the original pedestals that I had uncovered from a
            hidden basement and restored to be used again. I recorded the
            process of them being transported, the photos are an extract from this
            day.

            With this project I wanted to piece together a view of the remaining plaster collection
            that used to be the significant feature of the Royal Academy of Art
            The Hague up until the 1960s. The collection was made up of over
            6000 pieces from across Europe and now only a small handful are
            known to remain in the academy here today. There is very little
            report about where the plaster collection ended up, a few pieces
            were saved by the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam, and a few
            pieces remain until today in the family homes of graduates and
            professors from the 1960s. Articles from the 60s-80s which mention
            this moment are very sparse, they mention the removal and
            destruction of the plaster collection, but the published information
            <!-- doesn’t give any further view as to what happened in 1964. After
            talks with a professor in London and alumni from the 1960s I’ve
            managed to piece together a view of where fragments of the smashed
            plaster collection have come to rest. These ongoing conversations
            that I am having are to try to get a bigger picture of this moment
            of destruction in the 60s and address it today. I want to tell the
            story, the relational aspects that shape it along the way are
            what interest me. In uncovering this story, I come to see it as at a
            time when a lot of these stories could be lost forever if not
            addressed at this moment when a great deal of the alumni from the
            1960s have passed away in the past years. I would like to share this
            with them and a wider audience. -->
