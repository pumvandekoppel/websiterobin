      <p>
        For this project I worked with a concrete boulder that I created at the
        start of the Covid-19 panademic. <br />
        When the lockdown started here in The Netherlands I began to transport
        this “rock” across the city by hand to a different site every few weeks.
        I would leave it in the public space outside houses, museums and parks.
        As the rock started to gain the public attention and interest as to
        whats it purpose was people started to request the presence of the rock
        in their neighborhoods, or outside their galleries. This was a way of
        them almost grasping the artwork while very much shaping the project.
        The photo below is from the series of “rock talk” events that I worked
        on with a group of young artist initiatives. In the first two of these
        gatherings we began to discuss how to continue collectively after the
        corona crisis. The rock was a space for a discourse that included the
        artsit community alongside the everyday public that passed by. To the
        right is a photo of a publication that I made to conclude the project,
        it included the dialogues between me and the public from the whole of
        the project. The publication was then distributed between everyone who
        encountered the rock, in the neighborhoods where the rock had been
        present and the galleries that had hosted it.
