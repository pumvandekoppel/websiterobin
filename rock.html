            For this project I worked with a concrete boulder that I created at the
            start of the Covid-19 pandemic. <br />
            When the lockdown started here in The Netherlands I began to transport
            this <em>rock</em> across the city by hand to a different site every few weeks.
            I would leave it in the public space outside houses, museums and parks.
            As the rock started to gain the public attention and interest as to
            whats it purpose was people started to request the presence of the rock
            in their neighborhoods, or outside their galleries. This was a way of
            them almost grasping the artwork while very much shaping the project.

            These photo series are from the “rock talk” events that I worked
            on with a group of young artist initiatives. In the first two of these
            gatherings we began to discuss how to continue collectively after the
            corona crisis. The rock was a space for a discourse that included the
            artist community alongside the everyday public that passed by.
