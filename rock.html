              For this project I worked with a concrete boulder that I created
              at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. <br />
              When the lockdown started here in The Netherlands I began to
              transport this <em>Rock</em> across the city by hand to a
              different site every few weeks. I would leave it in the public
              space outside houses, museums and parks. As the Rock started to
              gain the public attention and interest as to whats it purpose was
              people started to request the presence of the rock in their
              neighborhoods, or outside their galleries. This was a way of them
              almost grasping the artwork while very much shaping the project.

              These photo series are from the “Rock talk” events that I worked
              on with a group of young artist initiatives. In the first two of
              these gatherings we began to discuss how to continue collectively
              after the corona crisis. The rock was a space for a discourse that
              included the artist community alongside the everyday public that
              passed by. <br />
