              “Lobsters in the sea, its climbed the economic ladder, rising from
              the ocean’s depths, food for poor people and prisoners, all the
              way to a fancy restaurant, portraying high-class toxic
              hierarchies. But what have the Lobsters felt? They’ve been boiled
              and cut from their back to the tip of their tail they’ve been
              snapped and cracked, squished and licked, sucked from their strong
              shell transformed into the idea of hedonism and affluence.” —
              Robin Phoenix Whitehouse and Todor Rabadzhiyski <br><br>'Lobster and
              shrimp on my plate, I need my pockets so fat they inflate' is a
              durational project that started three years ago and delves into
              the culture and changing economy associated with lobsters. In the
              third showcase of their ongoing project at Swimming Pool, artists
              Robin Phoenix Whitehouse (UK) and Todor Rabadzhiyski (BG) are
              looking at how the lobster has been reinvented through the ages,
              considering how marketing has portrayed a certain image of the
              lobster that is becoming an analogy for the current time.
