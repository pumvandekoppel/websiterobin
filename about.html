      <div><blockquote>"The contextual awareness carries your work, the actual work is the social dynamic around your subject. Still the work itself "works" as a work. You are able to tap into an intuitive level whilst remaining clear about the contextual drives. The process of starting and making a work is clearly shredded with a fascination you have about history or phenomenon, which you activate anew by making the work, and thus adding and changing its threads of stories."</blockquote>- Carl-Johan Högberg <br> <br>from interview with Anastasia <br> "I like to work on projects that are shaped from interactions and relations. To be immersed within the surroundings and context," For me the relational aspect of this project has been crucial; bringing people together, gathering information from various sorts of people, everyone I have talked to so far, who have generously shared and contributed their stories, the different angles and perspectives I have had to take to negotiate on behalf of various institutions, this has all been a fundamental part of my research.”</blockquote></div>
